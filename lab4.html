        <p>
         
		Module 4 features the study of Trees that can be produced from Fractals. 
		In this module, I created a tree with random colors, random flowers, and even birds with a nest.
		Loop and random functions were particularly helpful.
		The Fractal Tree code was converted into an L-system code.

	Sample Code #1: 
	    -Draws a fractal tree by recursion and turtle graphics.
	    -Branches into 2 smaller branches. 
	    -Base Case is when the recursion depth reaches 0, the branches stop, the initial recursion depth is 7 times.
	    -The branch is drawn by a certain length (of 100) forward at first and 70% of the last branch.
	    -The left branch is drawn first, then the right branch, before repeating.
	    -a 500x500 grid is set with the center at 250x450 and the turtle facing up with lines drawn in green.

Experimental Code 1:
	    -A fractal tree is now drawn with the option of random vibrant colors per each branch.
	    -Branches are produced to the left and the right at random angles between 20 and 40 degrees versus fixed 30 degrees. 
	    -This causes asymmetry, but also a more natural tree shape.
	    -matplotlib was used versus turtle for ease of coding.
	    -In some cases, radians were used versus degrees, particularly inside the cos/sin functions

Experimental Code Set 3:
	    -Flowers can now appear in more locations of the tree. 
	    -The span of recursions they can appear is 2 to 4, inclusive.

	    -These include 3, 6, and 7 petal roses, sprial flowers, and circular flowers.
	    -Rose petals that are higher create more intricate flowers.
	    -Spiral flowers have a varied winding rate determined by 6*t
	    -Circle flowers have a set radius of 0.05

Experimental Code Set #4:
	    -On the larger tree, two birds and a nest were added.
	    -The initial design with randomly colored branches and flowers was expanded upon.
	    -A new type of flower in star was added.
	    -Two birds max, were drawn, with the red being "dad" and the cyan being "mom."
	    -The colors and size of birds were purposely chosen to be distinct.
	    -The simple circle with "V" shaped wings were chosen for the birds.
	    -A distinct oval shaped nest was created and filled with brown color.
	    -Inside the nest, between 1 and 3 eggs or hatched baby birds were placed.
	    -The probability distribution of eggs vs hatched was randomly assigned.
	    -Eggs were made light yellow and hatched were orange.
	    -an if/if not loop and counter kept track/updated how many bird(s) out of two and nest(s) out of one, were placed.
	    -Once two and one were hit, there were no more birds nor nests drawn.
	    -Birds, Nest, and Flowers were placed in separate areas/regions/orders/depths of the tree.
	    -The exact position of the two birds and the one nest are printed.

Experimental Code Set #5:
	    -The simple Fractal Tree Code was converted into an L-system code.
	    -The code was rewritten using strings as the L-system code uses strings.
	    -Production rules were established and performed for five iterations:
	    - "X" was the starting string.
	    - "F" meant forward.
	    - "+" meant turn right by angle whereas "-" meant turn left by angle.
	    - "[" meant start a new brancj while "]" meant return to last branch.
	    -These five options of "F" , "+" , "-" , "[", and "]" were placed in a loop.
	    -Branch length doubled per iteration (vs decaying).
	    -The tree structure was definitive/deterministic (vs random).
	    -The tree had a "mathematically perfect symmetry" to it.

Experimental Code Set #6:
	-Leaves and flowers are now added to the branches and the ends of branches respectively.
	-The branch ends are identified by where an "F" is not followed by another "F" in a string by a function defined to check this..
	-The sizes and positions of leaves and flowers vary for a natural look.
	-There is a 20% chance that a leaf appears.
	-The leavesa are green ovals while the flowers are random colors.

        <h2>Results &amp; Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          This code overall was very neat. I had a lot of fun with the birds and nest one.
		The trees exhibit symmetry and self-similarity with the branches, flowers, and birds.
		It was neat to see a different style of tree produced by the L-system code.
		The fractal tree code and the L-system code each had a different look to them. 
		The L-system tree looked "windblown" wheras the fractal tree did not.

        <p>
		
       Module 4 featured the study of Trees that can be produced from Fractals. 
	In this module, I created a trees of two different styles with random colors, random flowers, and even birds with a nest.

	This module summarized some common fractal patterns in nature such as trees, flowers, etc...
