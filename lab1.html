        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        
          Is this where Module 1 goes, LOL? I guess so. This is a brief intro for Module 1 Turtle Graphics:

		This code will initialize a turtle, set the color and background, move to a suitable starting position, and draw a simple square.
		The code will then be altered to adjust the above. Different shapes, directions, and background color will be coded.

		The second set of code will draw randomly colored shapes that increase in number of sizes.
		The code will then be altered to adjust the above. Different shapes, directions, and background color will be coded.

		The third set of code will combine the idea behind the two previous sets. 
		A turtle will be drawn on top of a randomly colored square to 64-gon. 
		Each side will be a different color. The direction of motion will switch each shape.
		The first set of code will then be condensed to more efficently perform the same thing.

		Again, enjoy the intro to coding.

        <h2>Results &amp; Analysis</h2>
        <p>

FIRST CODE SET:
		
          The first set of sample code initialized a turtle. It set the line color of the path to be blue and the background color to be white. 
		The turtle started at X=200 and Y=200. It faced up, or north, at 0 degrees.
		A square was then drawn using the loop feature. This was easily done by setting the angle to 90 degrees. 
		A right turn was made after every 100 distance forwards.
		The drawing was then shown. 

		<pre><code class="language-python">
		See the code below:
		# GIVEN EXAMPLE: Initialize the turtle
		initializeTurtle()
		showturtle()
		color('blue')
		bgcolor('white')

		# Move to a suitable starting position
		jump(200, 200)  # Adjust these values as needed to center the square
		face(0)  # Ensure the turtle is facing up

		# Draw a simple square
			for _ in range(4):
			  forward(100)
			  right(90)

		# Display the drawing
		show()
		</code></pre>

        </figure>

	  The first set of experimented code initialized a turtle. 
		It set the line color of the path to be orange and the background color to be black. This looked cool!
		The turtle started at X=400 and Y=200. It faced down, or south, at 180 degrees.
		An octagon was then drawn using the loop feature. This was easily done by setting the angle to 45 degrees. 
		A right turn was made after every 50 distance forwards.
		Then, a 16-gon was then drawn using the loop feature. This was easily done by setting the angle to 22.5 degrees. 
		A right turn was made after every 50 distance backwards.
		The drawings were then shown. I could have drawn more, but I did not want to clutter the space so much.

	      See the code below:
	      <pre><code class="language-python">
		
		# Experimental EXAMPLE: Initialize the turtle
		initializeTurtle()
		showturtle()
		color('orange') #line color is now orange
		bgcolor('black') #background color is now black
		#method(parameter)

		# Move to a suitable starting position
		jump(400, 200)  # kept the same starting location on y, but shifted x right 200
		face(180)  # Ensure the turtle is facing down

		#Shape 1:
		# Draw a simple octagon using the loop function
		for _ in range(8):
		  forward(50) #go forward 50
		  right(45) #turns 45 degrees clockwise

		#Shape 2:
		# Draw a simple 16-gon using the loop function
		for _ in range(16):
		  backward(50) #go backward 50
		  right(22.5) #turns 22.5 degrees clockwise

		# Display the drawing
		show()

SECOND CODE SET:

	 The second set of sample code drew a set of randomly colored polygons that steadily increased in size and side length.
		It started with 3 sides and continued, increasing side length by 1, until it got to 20 sides. 
		Between each shape, the pen was lifted before drawing the next shape. 
		Each polygon was guaranteed to have a vertical left side.
		Later polygons overlapped with each other or became more circular due to the increased sizes.

		See code below:
	      <pre><code class="language-python">
		#This lesson will draw a set of randomly colored polygons
		#sample code

		# Step 1: Initialize the turtle canvas
		canvas_width = 1000
		canvas_height = 800
		initializeTurtle(initial_window_size=(canvas_width, canvas_height), mode='auto')

		# Step 2: Set up helper functions for random colors and drawing polygons

		import random
		import math

		# Function to generate a random color in RGB format
		def random_color():
		    r = random.random()
 		    g = random.random()
  		    b = random.random()
   		    return color_rgb(r, g, b)

		# Function to draw a polygon with 'n_sides' and the given 'side_length'
		def draw_polygon(n_sides, side_length):
		    angle = 360 / n_sides  # Calculate the internal angle of the polygon
		    for _ in range(n_sides):
 	  	     forward(side_length)
  	  	     right(angle)

		# Step 3: Draw a horizontal line of polygons, increasing the number of sides from 3 to 20

		# Starting position for the line of polygons (positive coordinates, on-screen)
		start_x = 100  # Start at x = 200 (positive)
		start_y = 300  # Start at y = 300 (positive, going down the canvas)
		jump(start_x, start_y)  # Move the turtle to the starting point

		side_length = 20  # Length of each side of the polygon
		spacing = 20  # Spacing between each polygon

		for n_sides in range(3, 20):
 		   color(random_color())  # Set a random color for each polygon
 		   draw_polygon(n_sides, side_length)  # Draw the polygon with n sides
  		   penup()  # Stop drawing when moving to the next position
   	 	   jump(getx() + spacing + side_length, start_y)  # Move to the right for the next polygon
   	  	   pendown()  # Start drawing again

		# Step 4: Display the result
		show()
	      </code></pre>

	 The second set of experimental code drew a set of randomly colored polygons that steadily increased in size and side length.
		It started with 4 sides and continued, increasing side length by 1, until it got to 15 sides. 
		Between each shape, the pen was lifted before drawing the next shape. 
		Each polygon was guaranteed to have a vertical left side. 
		The increased spacing to 40 made each polygon more visible.
		The black background and the neon colors made the shapes pop.
		I could have drawn more, but I did not want to clutter the space so much.

		See code below:

	      <pre><code class="language-python">
		#This lesson will draw a set of randomly colored polygons
		#experimental code

		# Step 1: Initialize the turtle canvas
		# I made the width wider and the height shorter
		canvas_width = 1500
		canvas_height = 600
		initializeTurtle(initial_window_size=(canvas_width, canvas_height), mode='auto')
		bgcolor('black') #background color is now black

		# Step 2: Set up helper functions for random colors and drawing polygons

		import random
		import math

		# Function to generate a random color in RGB format
		def random_color():
    		    r = random.random()
    		    g = random.random()
    		    b = random.random()
    		    return color_rgb(r, g, b)

		# Function to draw a polygon with 'n_sides' and the given 'side_length'
		def draw_polygon(n_sides, side_length):
		    angle = 360 / n_sides  # Calculate the internal angle of the polygon
   		    for _ in range(n_sides):
       		      forward(side_length) #this moves the shape forward (x+) by the side_length
        	      right(angle) #this makes the shape have a vertical side on the left

		# Step 3: Draw a horizontal line of polygons, increasing the number of sides from 4 to 15
		# I started with a square and ended with a 15-gon, just because

		# Starting position for the line of polygons (positive coordinates, on-screen)
		# slightly adjusted the starting position
		start_x = 150  # Start at x = 150 (positive)
		start_y = 300  # Start at y = 300 (positive, going down the canvas)
		jump(start_x, start_y)  # Move the turtle to the starting point

		side_length = 40  # Length of each side of the polygon is now 40
		spacing = 40  # Spacing between each polygon is now 40

		for n_sides in range(4, 15):
    		    color(random_color())  # Set a random color for each polygon
    		    draw_polygon(n_sides, side_length)  # Draw the polygon with n sides
    		    penup()  # Stop drawing when moving to the next position
    		    jump(getx() + spacing + side_length, start_y)  # Move to the right for the next polygon
    		    pendown()  # Start drawing again
    		    # this will draw every polygon from 4 sides to 15 sides with spacing

		# Step 4: Display the result
		show()
		#the neon colors look cool on the black background!

THIRD CODE SET:

	 The third set of code combines concepts from the first two sets. It had a turtle follow paths of shapes that increasing sides in random colors.
		The first code was written by spearating each shape into its own loop.
		The second code was written by clumping shapes with an if/else loop based on if the turtle moved backwards or forwards.
		The background was set to black to make the shapes pop. Side length was 25 to make the shapes fit on a default size grid. 
		The center was at x=600 and y=300

		See code below:

		# Combined FUN EXAMPLE: Using the turtle path: I made a octagon, then 16-gon that produced random colors of lines
		# The starting line is yellow, but it's still randomized
		#Initialize the turtle
		initializeTurtle()
		showturtle()
		color('yellow')
		bgcolor('black')

		#Set up helper functions for random colors and drawing polygons

		# Move to a suitable starting position
		jump(600, 300)  # Adjust these values as needed to center the shapes
		face(0)  # Ensure the turtle is facing up

		#Draw a simple square, then octagon, then 16-gon, then 32-gon, then 64-gon

  		   backward(25)
  		   right(90)

		#1 loops from square to 64-gon are completed

	This is a more refined code that does the same thing.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> The purpose of this first module was for exploring and learning basic coding tactics off of provided code. 
		I took care to make each example a little different. 
		Then, I successfully combined the two examples into a more complex version.
